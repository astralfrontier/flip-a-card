What now?\" -- Basler\nThis encounter includes something important that is heavily defended.\nThe defense could be literal armor, like a hardened barrier of metal, stone, leather, wood, or the like.\nIt could also be a protective aura of magic, a divine blessing, or a natural body or structure made of something tough.\nNo matter what form it takes, the armor defends against specific kinds of damage.\nWhen you play this card describe the defenses and what they affect.  You may be challenged if you try to penetrate or circumvent the armor to get to what's inside.\nSomething armored may:\n","prompts":["Ignore harm from typical weapons or other sources of damage","Destroy weaker things that strike it or are struck by it","Protect unarmored allies"],"rule":"Flip to see ways to meet the encounter's challenges."},"back":{"name":"Armored","tags":["encounter"],"desc":"//\"You know what metal does? Heats up. Fireball!\" -- Tana\nArmor must have a weakness or some kind of cost.\nArmoring something often reduces some other characteristic, such as nimbleness or speed. Some armor is particularly weak to something, or has a specific weak spot. Other armor requires effort or resources to maintain.\nYou can confront an Armored obstacle without a challenge if you can find and exploit one of these weaknesses.\nSomething armored may:\n","prompts":["Have limited senses that can be exploited by nimble, stealthy, or evasive opponents","Be forced to shed the armor if it's heated, if they sink, etc.","Be susceptible to area-effect attacks or those of a particular type (magic, psychic, electric, etc.)"],"rule":"Flip to see ways the encounter challenges the PCs."}},{"name":"Base","front":{"name":"Base","tags":["encounter"],"desc":"//\"Aheheh.. We come in peace?\" -- Basler\nThe encounter includes a place where creatures stay for a common purpose.\nA Base can be a temporary encampment, an outpost, a secret headquarters, a wild animal's den, or some other protected space.\nYou may be challenged if you try to find something specific in the base, find your way out or through, or confront its occupants and their preparations.\nA Base may:\n","prompts":["Bristle with defenders","Defy intrusion with traps, labyrinthine structure, or other clever preparations","Enable its defenders to cut off escape routes or easily give chase"],"rule":"Flip to see ways to meet the encounter's challenges."},"back":{"name":"Base","tags":["encounter"],"desc":"//\"Next time, I'll let my sword do the talking.\" -- Emory\nWhile Bases can be big and imposing, their nature can work against their occupants.\nTents, side-passages, stacked crates, and many other things can help a character even the odds. Camps have a lot of supplies that can be looted or bargained for.\nA Base may:\n","prompts":["House something you're looking for, or something unexpected that can help you","Rely on infrastructure that can be destroyed or disrupted","Give up secrets about the plans and activities of its occupants"],"rule":"Flip to see ways the encounter challenges the PCs."}},{"name":"Diabolical","front":{"name":"Diabolical","tags":["encounter"],"desc":"//\"Back, foul fiend! Light will overcome you!\" -- Emory\nA Diabolical encounter has the touch of evil. An actual summoned demon, a possessed victim, or a dark and malevolent force are all Diabolic.\nYou may be challenged if you engage with the Diabolical without proper protections or if you unknowingly encounter its influence.\nA Diabolical encounter may:\n","prompts":["Seek to corrupt or influence the vulnerable","Exploit moral weaknesses or dark secrets","Expose its true nature and hellish powers"],"rule":"Flip to see ways to meet the encounter's challenges."},"back":{"name":"Diabolical","tags":["encounter"],"desc":"//\"Basler, stop cringing. He's not talking about you.\" -- Woody\nEvil hasn't won, though it keeps trying. Powers from beyond are bound by their own rules too, and can be defeated accordingly.\nCharacters who arm themselves with occult lore or divine blessings may circumvent or neutralize a Diabolical power.\nA Diabolical encounter may:\n","prompts":["Be susceptible to folk incantations or rituals","Recoil from the pure of heart","Flee to fight another day"],"rule":"Flip to see ways the encounter challenges the PCs."}},{"name":"Elemental","front":{"name":"Elemental","tags":["encounter"],"desc":"//\"Earth sprites. They have the ore we seek.\" -- Tana\nThis encounter involves powerful elemental forces. It might be a being of elemental force, or a dangerous source of elemental power, like a volcano or a violent storm.\nThe classical elements are Air, Earth, Fire, and Water. Some traditions include others, such as Lightning, Darkness, or Holy.\nYou may be challenged by the raw power of an Elemental threat, or it can cause environmental dangers or obstacles.\nAn Elemental power may:\n","prompts":["Create, animate, or manipulate its element in useful or dangerous ways","Change the environment with aspects of its element, such as making rivers of fire or barriers of wind","Control or manipulate its element, even inside complex or living things, like the metal in electronics or the water in blood"],"rule":"Flip to see ways to meet the encounter's challenges."},"back":{"name":"Elemental","tags":["encounter"],"desc":"//\"They had some nice gemstones too!\" -- Basler\nThe elements represent a complex system with rules that can be exploited.\nEach element is usually weak to another element, such as fire being weak to water. Elements are also bound to their natures. Fire needs some sort of fuel to persist, for example.     \nYou can weaken or neutralize an Elemental threat by exploiting its vulnerabilities or using its nature against it.\nElemental threats may:\n","prompts":["Be vulnerable to their element's normal vulnerabilities or rules","Require a nearby source of the element to control, or just to survive"],"rule":"Flip to see ways the encounter challenges the PCs."}},{"name":"Flying","front":{"name":"Flying","tags":["encounter"],"desc":"//\"Did something just swoop overhead?\" -- Emory\nThis encounter includes an important aspect that can fly or is otherwise airborne.\nWinged creatures, skilled magicians, and others can fly. Floating platforms, mischievous winds, and more can keep important assets or dangers aloft.\nYou may be challenged when a flying threat holds your object out of reach, or when you try to affect something in the sky.\nFlying threats may:\n","prompts":["Strike targets on the ground without risking counterattacks","Move faster than those trapped on the ground, or reach places they can't","See greater distances or from better angles"],"rule":"Flip to see ways to meet the encounter's challenges."},"back":{"name":"Flying","tags":["encounter"],"desc":"//\"Meet my best girl, Annette! A net, get it?\" -- Basler\nFlight often comes with drawbacks or complications of its own.\nWings require lots of energy to sustain flight, and are often fragile. Magical or elemental sources of flight can be counter-spelled or negated. Turbulent air can thwart flyers, forcing them to ground, where they might be vulnerable.\nYou may avoid the challenge of a flyer by disturbing its source of flight or forcing it into situations where its flight won't help.\nFlying threats may:\n","prompts":["Become entangled, trapped, or confined in ways that negate flight","Be unable to lift heavy loads or fly under difficult conditions","Suffer great harm if they fall a great distance"],"rule":"Flip to see ways the encounter challenges the PCs."}},{"name":"Gang","front":{"name":"Gang","tags":["encounter"],"desc":"//\"They outnumber us 5 to 1, folks!\" -- Basler\nThis encounter includes a group of people or creatures bound together in common purpose.\nGangs can be organized, like criminal gangs or military units, or they can be informal groups, like angry mobs or startled herds of animals.\nYou may be challenged by a Gang's numerical advantage, or by its planning and influence.\nA Gang may:\n","prompts":["Surround or isolate individuals through strength in numbers","Shout down or bully a lone voice","Bring a variety of skills or resources to bear on a problem"],"rule":"Flip to see ways to meet the encounter's challenges."},"back":{"name":"Gang","tags":["encounter"],"desc":"//\"Sounds like fair odds to me. Have at you!\" -- Emory\nThe strength of a gang is in its numbers. Dealing with individual members can be very different from confronting the gang as a whole.\nWhile an assembled gang acts instinctively, individuals can be made to consider actions more carefully.\nYou may avoid or circumvent the challenge of a gang by disrupting the group, or by addressing individual members.\nA Gang may:\n","prompts":["Have competing impulses or mixed sympathies or agendas","Fall apart if a leader is weakened or shamed","Follow a new leader or impulse that better matches its agenda"],"rule":"Flip to see ways the encounter challenges the PCs."}},{"name":"Hybrid","front":{"name":"Hybrid","tags":["encounter"],"desc":"//\"A Gryphon. The heraldic symbol of my kingdom. Majestic!\" -- Emory\nA Hybrid being is made up of two or more things, not always living.\nSuch beings can be part-human (mermaids, harpies), mixed animal (cockatrices, pegasi), shapeshifters (werewolves), or weirder (tree-ogres).\nA Hybrid may pose a challenge if characters are unfamiliar with the combination.\nHybrid beings may:\n","prompts":["Use the best of their combined abilities","Use different abilities together in some unique way","Reveal a surprising new ability"],"rule":"Flip to see ways to meet the encounter's challenges."},"back":{"name":"Hybrid","tags":["encounter"],"desc":"//\"That thing was terrifying! Your kingdom is messed up!\" -- Basler\nNot every hybrid has a perfect command of its own nature. Hybrids must also obey the rules of all their component parts.\nA Hybrid may not pose a challenge if the characters exploit its weaknesses.\nHybrid beings may:\n","prompts":["Suffer the vulnerabilities of any of their contributing parts","Become confused by conflicting impulses or instincts"],"rule":"Flip to see ways the encounter challenges the PCs."}},{"name":"Large","front":{"name":"Large","tags":["encounter"],"desc":"//\"The bigger they are, the harder they fall!\" -- Tana\nThis encounter includes something of enormous size. It might be naturally large, like a dragon or a giant, or have been enlarged by magic or other forces.\nYou may be challenged if you can't overcome your diminutive size relative to a Large threat.\nA Large threat may:\n","prompts":["Resist human-scale attacks or effects","Reach or hit an entire area at once","Deal devastating damage to smaller creatures and objects"],"rule":"Flip to see ways to meet the encounter's challenges."},"back":{"name":"Large","tags":["encounter"],"desc":"//\"Just as long as it doesn't fall on us.\" -- Basler\nYou may have trouble engaging with a Large encounter due to the size difference, but that trouble goes both ways. It can be hard for Large things to perceive or target smaller foes.\nYou may counter the challenge of a Large encounter by  exploiting your respective sizes somehow.\nA Large threat may:\n","prompts":["Lose track of small details or targets","Be easily targeted due to its size","Move slowly or clumsily"],"rule":"Flip to see ways the encounter challenges the PCs."}},{"name":"Monstrous","front":{"name":"Monstrous","tags":["encounter"],"desc":"//\"That ain't no ordinary wolf, folks..\" -- Basler\nThis encounter includes something twisted and malign.\nMonstrous treats are altered forms of the familiar. They are fiercer, more feral, or disturbingly unnatural.\nThe characteristics of a mundane thing become exaggerated and gruesome. Muscles knot and bulge. Jaws elongate and bristle with vicious fangs. Hide thickens and goes patchy. All is as seen through the lens of nightmare.\nYou may be challenged by a Monstrous threat's adaptations, or by it's relentless aggression.\nMonstrous threats can:\n","prompts":["Lash out savagely","Use their adaptions to overwhelm the unprepared","Terrify onlookers with their awful nature"],"rule":"Flip to see ways to meet the encounter's challenges."},"back":{"name":"Monstrous","tags":["encounter"],"desc":"//\"Whoever corrupted this creature will pay. Let's press on.\" -- Woody\nA Monstrous threat is powered by its rage or aggression, but those can be its downfall as well.\nMonstrous creatures often lack a sense of self-preservation, fighting relentlessly when others would retreat.\nYou may avoid the challenge of a Monstrous threat by taking advantage of its twisted, feral nature.\nMonstrous threats may:\n","prompts":["Lose themselves in their own ferocity","Fall into traps when skillfully goaded","Misunderstand those not driven by similar instincts"],"rule":"Flip to see ways the encounter challenges the PCs."}},{"name":"Notorious","front":{"name":"Notorious","tags":["encounter"],"desc":"//\"That's Gretamaw, the Beaked Butcher!\" -- Basler\nThis encounter includes someone or something that bards sing about.\nA Notorious monster whispered of by fearful villagers. A place of power that most folks avoid. An artifact of legend, replete with arcane power. A person known for great or terrible deeds.\nName this notorious thing, and tell us the legends about it.\nYou may be challenged by the weight of Notorious reputation, by those who follow or worship it, or by the very power that made it famous.\nNotorious things may:\n","prompts":["Impress or intimidate you with their presence","Live up to the legend in a big way","Reveal some unexpected or unreported ability"],"rule":"Flip to see ways to meet the encounter's challenges."},"back":{"name":"Notorious","tags":["encounter"],"desc":"//\"Save the beak. We need it to claim the reward!\" -- Basler\nFame has its price.\nIf the stories that have gotten around are accurate, you might know how to take on this encounter - maybe.\nSometimes tales are false, and notorious things prove to be very different than you expect.\nYou may avoid the challenge of a Notorious threat when you correctly leverage its lore, or when you look at it with fresh eyes and discover the truth behind the stories. \nNotorious threats may:\n","prompts":["Behave or react just as the legends say","Draw unwanted attention to themselves in the region","Hold a deeper, unsung truth"],"rule":"Flip to see ways the encounter challenges the PCs."}},{"name":"Portentous","front":{"name":"Portentous","tags":["encounter"],"desc":"//\"Where are all those crows going?\" -- Tana\nThis encounter foreshadows something important. It can be a mystical experience, laden with dreams and prophecy, or just a mundane glimpse into a momentous reality beyond.\nOminous encounters not only foretell change, but confront a character with a question: are you ready for what comes next?\nPortentous encounters may:\n","prompts":["Give a taste of things to come","Force people into hard moral or personal choices","Subtly mingle the mundane and the symbolic or dreamlike"],"rule":"Flip to see ways to meet the encounter's challenges."},"back":{"name":"Portentous","tags":["encounter"],"desc":"//\"They're going the same way we are. Come on.\" -- Woody\nThe Portentous is the first step on a larger road. It both surprises characters, and prepares them for what is next.\nYou may avoid the challenge of Portentous encounters by meeting the future they suggest with your eyes open.\nPortentous encounters may:\n","prompts":["Reveal an important clue or suggest a strategy","Unlock a hidden strength or personal conviction"],"rule":"Flip to see ways the encounter challenges the PCs."}},{"name":"Spectral","front":{"name":"Spectral","tags":["encounter"],"desc":"//\"My arrows go right through it.\" -- Woody\nThis encounter includes something ghostly or purely spiritual.\nGhosts or entities from other dimensions have obligations or passions that manifest them or keep them in the mortal world.\nA Spectral threat might want to stay here or be released to its natural place. It may be frightened, angry, or confused.\nYou may be challenged by a Spectral threat if you can't interact with it, or if its otherworldly nature has dangerous effects. A Spectral threat may:\n","prompts":["Pass selectively through solid matter or people","Wield morbid magics like chilling touch or possession","Ravenously pursue something the living have that it wants"],"rule":"Flip to see ways to meet the encounter's challenges."},"back":{"name":"Spectral","tags":["encounter"],"desc":"//\"I'll have a magic circle up in a moment!\" -- Tana\nSpectral beings came to the waking world for a reason, whether for mischief, malice, or other needs. The bonds holding them to life are tenuous, and if they're given what they want, or can no longer get it, they might be forced back.\nSpectral encounter may not pose a challenge if their objective is obtained, threatened, or destroyed. A Spectral threat may:\n","prompts":["Be forced back into the other world by applying arcane lore","Be weakened or repulsed by warding rituals","Make a compromise to achieve its objective"],"rule":"Flip to see ways the encounter challenges the PCs."}},{"name":"Tense","front":{"name":"Tense","tags":["encounter"],"desc":"//\"Deep breaths. Stay calm. Show them we're friends.\" -- Tana\nThe encounter includes a highly charged situation that affects some or all of the beings present.\nMaybe someone expects something momentous to happen at any moment. Maybe two or more parties are on the verge of taking drastic action. Whatever it is, it's got the situation on edge and ready to explode.\nA Tense situation isn't decided yet. Maybe you can reason with those feeling the pressure, but they're on the alert and could be ready to lash out or run away.\nYou may be challenged to navigate a Tense situation without triggering a bad outcome, or losing an important opportunity. \nBeings in a Tense situation may:\n","prompts":["Lash out with ill-considered action","Make bad assessments or assume the worst","Heedlessly run away, often making things worse"],"rule":"Flip to see ways to meet the encounter's challenges."},"back":{"name":"Tense","tags":["encounter"],"desc":"//\"You mean the real villain all this time was...?!\" -- Emory\nIf you discover the reason for a Tense situation, you can often find ways to diffuse things.\nIf you don't get caught up in the tension, maybe you can talk the others down, or pacify them.\nYou may avoid the challenge of a Tense situation by getting all the facts and making careful choices in your approach.\nBeings in a Tense situation may:\n","prompts":["Hold the key to a secret or a misunderstanding","Exchange their trust for support","Overlook past beliefs and opinions in the stress of the moment"],"rule":"Flip to see ways the encounter challenges the PCs."}},{"name":"Toxic","front":{"name":"Toxic","tags":["encounter"],"desc":"//\"Don't let it touch you! Your skin will rot away!\" -- Woody\nThis encounter includes something that can poison you.\nVenomous creatures, assassins with poisoned blades,  swamp gasses, and many other things can afflict you with sickness.

It will harm anyone, friend or foe.\nSome toxins have antidotes, or may not penetrate some kinds of defense. For example, a snake's fangs might be deflected by armor.\nYou may avoid the challenge of a Toxic threat if you discover its secrets or thwart its method of delivery.\nA Toxic threat may:\n","prompts":["Inadvertently harm allies, or themselves if they are not immune","Be unable to deliver its poison if you find adequate protection","Fail to harm something or someone with a natural or acquired immunity"],"rule":"Flip to see ways the encounter challenges the PCs."}},{"name":"Undead","front":{"name":"Undead","tags":["encounter"],"desc":"//\"This unholy abomination will fall!\" -- Emory\nThis encounter includes the animated dead.\nNecromancy, curses, or strange phenomena can bring a deceased creature back to a false life. The being is sustained by magic; the rules of biology no longer apply. Some undead are mindless, while others are disturbingly cunning. They are frightening reminders of mortality and are often endowed with dread powers.\nYou may be challenged when you confront the undead using the  same tactics you would use against mortal foes.\nAn Undead threat may:\n","prompts":["Ignore attacks or effects that target life force","Sustain more damage than normal before being defeated","Infect those they harm with a plague or sickness"],"rule":"Flip to see ways to meet the encounter's challenges."},"back":{"name":"Undead","tags":["encounter"],"desc":"//\"Not so much fell as fell apart...\" -- Basler\nBeing sustained by dark magic, the undead are equally vulnerable to it.\nMany cannot abide holy objects, places, or effects. Others are bound by orders to only guard a certain place, or do a certain thing.\nYou can avoid the challenge of an Undead threat if you learn what raised them and why, and use that knowledge to outsmart or dispel them.\nAn Undead threat may:\n","prompts":["Weaken or expire in the presence of the sacred or the pure","Fall prey to tricks or traps a thinking being could avoid","Have limitations its creator didn't anticipate"],"rule":"Flip to see ways the encounter challenges the PCs."}}]}}}
