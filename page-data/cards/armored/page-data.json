Heats up. Fireball!\" -- Tana\nArmor must have a weakness or some kind of cost.\nArmoring something often reduces some other characteristic, such as nimbleness or speed. Some armor is particularly weak to something, or has a specific weak spot. Other armor requires effort or resources to maintain.\nYou can confront an Armored obstacle without a challenge if you can find and exploit one of these weaknesses.\nSomething armored may:\n","prompts":["Have limited senses that can be exploited by nimble, stealthy, or evasive opponents","Be forced to shed the armor if it's heated, if they sink, etc.","Be susceptible to area-effect attacks or those of a particular type (magic, psychic, electric, etc.)"],"rule":"Flip to see ways the encounter challenges the PCs."}}]}}}
