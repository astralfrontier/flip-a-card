- front: &Criminal
    <<: *dynamic-front
    name: Criminal
    desc: >
      Two neighborhoods are connected via criminal activity.
      This could range from petty theft or pickpocketing,
      to smuggling of contraband, to intimidation or murder.
      Not every criminal is disliked; someone who steals from
      the rich to give to the poor will be popular among the poor.

      A stable Criminal dynamic often means organized crime,
      such as a cartel, criminal fraternity, thieves' guild,
      or the like.
    prompts:
      - What kinds of laws exist in the city? Which ones are being broken?
      - Who enforces those laws? Why aren't they doing so here?
      - How does the public view this criminal element, e.g. as heroes or villains?

      An unstable Criminal dynamic might mean gang war
      between rival criminal factions. It might also mean
      a single leader is responsible, and they could be taken
      down via force or guile.
