      //"Welcome to the Labri Market! You can find anything here." -- Basler

      You grew up in a highly populated center of trade and culture.
      People with needs offered what they had, or sometimes more,
      and you did it too.

      You can engage with a situation via negotiation.
      You can compromise, dissemble, stall for time, or press for results.
      You know how to backtrack and try other approaches if one fails.
    prompts:
      - Engage in diplomacy or mercantile haggling
      - Navigate a physical or social labyrinth
      - Gauge someone's wants or needs

      //"...For the right price." -- Basler

      Not everything can be reduced to a commercial transaction,
      but city dwellers sometimes try anyway.
      Some of what you've seen has made you numb.
      Other times, you've decided rightly or wrongly
      that you can't help, and have moved on anyway.
    prompts:
      - Trade principles or ideals for material gain
      - Overcomplicate a plan or solution
      - Look past pain or hurt rather than soothe it
