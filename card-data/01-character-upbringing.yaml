      //"Welcome to the Labri Market! You can find anything here." -- Basler

      You grew up in a highly populated center of trade and culture.
      People with needs offered what they had, or sometimes more,
      and you did it too.

      You're familiar with art, commerce, and political power.
      You've seen people from all over, and have heard
      or can even speak multiple languages.

      You often approach situations via negotiation.
    prompts:
      - Make a deal or haggle over details
      - Navigate a physical or social labyrinth
      - Gauge someone's wants or needs

      //"...For the right price." -- Basler

      Not everything can be reduced to a commercial transaction,
      but city dwellers sometimes try anyway.
      Some of what you've seen has made you numb.
      Other times, you've decided rightly or wrongly
      that you can't help, and have moved on anyway.
    prompts:
      - Compromise a principle or ideal for expedience
      - Overcomplicate a plan or solution
      - Look past pain or hurt rather than soothe it
- front: &Country
    <<: *tfront
    name: Country
    desc: >
      //"Take a deep breath of that country air!" -- Tana

      You grew up among farmers, ranchers, or other folk who lived
      off the land. You might have lived in a tight-knit community,
      or been miles away from the nearest neighbor.

      You're familiar with the plants or animals of your region.
      You're used to putting in an honest day's work.

      You often approach situations via effort.
    prompts:
      - Endure wearying labor, physical or emotional
      - Devise practical solutions to hard problems
      - Understand someone's unspoken hardships

      //"Smells like cow breakfast" -- Basler

      Not everyone appreciates the necessity of hard work.
      But sometimes, just plowing through isn't the right answer either.
      You're used to getting down in the mud,
      but it's important to reach for the stars as well.
    prompts:
      - Condemn someone for shunning hard work
      - Balk at complex explanations or solutions
      - Conceal a weakness or feeling
- front: &Frontier
    <<: *tfront
    name: Frontier

      //"The forest demands self-sufficiency" -- Woody

      You grew up at the edges of civilization, whether a harsh
      desert, a lonely mountain, a deep forest, or somewhere
      equally remote. You learned to fend for yourself from
      a young age.

      You can hunt, trap, or otherwise obtain your basic necessities.
      Your life is a careful balance of trust and caution.

      You often approach situations through resourcefulness.
    prompts:
      - Come well-prepard for difficulties
      - Persist in the face of doubt
      - Change assumptions about what's possible

      //"Well the forest sounds pretty demanding" -- Basler

      When much of your life is preoccupied with taking care
      of yourself and your needs, it's easy to lose sight of
      others' wants.
      Carefulness and selfishness are matters of degree.
    prompts:
      - Take something others need later for what you need now
      - Cross a line in pursuit of your goals
      - Violate expectations of what's permitted

      //"Leave me alone" -- Woody

      You often approach situations through isolation.
    prompts:
      - Shut out distractions
      - Present a reassuring facade
      - Keep moving even when hope is lost

      //"Nobody fights for people like us. So we fight for ourselves." -- Basler
      
      You grew up among people who were neglected or rejected
      by a surrounding society.
      Your family or neighbors could have been criminals, migrants,
      members of a disliked minority or species, or anything else.

      You often approach situations via pride.
    prompts:
      - Stand up for yourself and those like you
      - Rally those who question themselves
      - Obtain your needs through a social network

      //"When everyone hates you, it's hard not to hate them back." -- Basler

      Sometimes, circumstances push people to a breaking point.
      Other times, doing the right thing becomes impossible,
      and you're left with doing the necessary thing.
    prompts:
      - Lash out at threats to your ego
      - Build yourself up in the eyes of the impressionable
      - Run afoul of those in power
