uses`}</li>\n    </ul>\n    <h2>{`Using cards`}</h2>\n    <p>{`The GM should arrange the cards into stacks, matching cards up by symbol.\nFor example, all condition cards should go together in a single stack.\nCards start out on the front face (indicated by an up-arrow) to begin with.`}</p>\n    <p>{`An individual card is either in play, or it's not.\nArrange cards in your play area such that it's clear which cards are or are not.\nIf a card is \"discarded\", it goes back to wherever you drew it from.`}</p>\n    <h2>{`Creating new cards`}</h2>\n    <p>{`The group as a whole not only can create new cards, it should create new cards.\nThe existing cards are examples, meant to inspire.\nThe GM, in their Referee role, has the final say on whether a new card enters play or not.`}</p>\n    <h1>{`Setting up the game (\"Session 0\")`}</h1>\n    <p>{`The GM will lead the group in answering the following questions.`}</p>\n    <p><strong parentName=\"p\">{`What is the genre or tone of the game?`}</strong>{`\nThis can be \"high fantasy\", \"dark gothic fantasy\", and so on.\nThe pre-written cards are slanted toward a traditional fantasy game.\nNew cards can be written to enable a different experience.`}</p>\n    <p><strong parentName=\"p\">{`What are the pole stars for the game?`}</strong>{`\nPole stars are in-game issues that motivate the characters.\nSee the section below for how to create issues.`}</p>\n    <p><strong parentName=\"p\">{`Who are the principal characters?`}</strong>{`\nEvery player except the GM should create a PC.\nSee the section below for how to create PCs.`}</p>\n    <p>{`You can create PCs or issues in any order.\nOne group might want to decide on issues before they make characters.\nAnother group might do the reverse.\nYou might even create and then revise PCs as issues get discussed.`}</p>\n    <h2>{`Creating pole stars`}</h2>\n    <p>{`Pole stars are what the game is \"about\", at least at the start of play.\nThey're elements of the game world like \"rune magic\" or \"the dragons\" or \"the westward migration\".`}</p>\n    <p>{`The group as a whole should decide on two pole stars to begin the game.\nIf the group is small (two or three PCs), pick only one pole star.\nDiscuss as a group what a pole star means, or leave some of it undecided.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Once the pole stars have been decided,\neach player decides their character's position on that pole star.\nFor example, maybe Tana `}<em parentName=\"p\">{`wants to learn`}</em>{` rune magic, Basler `}<em parentName=\"p\">{`is curious`}</em>{` about it,\nEmory `}<em parentName=\"p\">{`is ignorant`}</em>{` of it, and Woody `}<em parentName=\"p\">{`mistrusts`}</em>{` it.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Pole star positions shouldn't put PCs into direct conflict with each other.\nIf one person wants to kill dragons and another wants to protect them,\npick a new pole star that lets the characters coexist as comrades.`}</p>\n    <p>{`If every character has a similar position, the group should probably pick a different pole star.\nFor example, if everyone thinks dragons are cool,\nyou can pick a new pole star that's related to dragons,\nlike \"dragon tamers\", or go with something unrelated.\nDragons can still be in the game in that case, but not as a pole star.`}</p>\n    <p>{`A pole star is some focal point for character motivations.\nPole stars and postions can and should change in play.\nThe players will discover new things they care about.\nCharacters might take new positions on existing issues.\nFor example, once the westward migration is underway,\nthe players might choose a new pole star or new attitudes about it.`}</p>\n    <h3>{`Example pole stars and positions`}</h3>\n    <ul>\n      <li parentName=\"ul\">{`(Protect, manipulate, befriend, get

explore, warn the world about) the elemental imbalance`}</li>\n    </ul>\n    <h2>{`Creating player characters`}</h2>\n    <p>{`The GM should help other players create characters,\nby asking driving questions, and encouraging collaboration between players.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Character cards are divided into three groups:`}</p>\n    <ul>\n      <li parentName=\"ul\"><strong parentName=\"li\">{`Upbringing`}</strong>{` tells us about a character's backstory and relationships`}</li>\n      <li parentName=\"ul\"><strong parentName=\"li\">{`Role`}</strong>{` tells us a character's motivation, goals, and nature`}</li>\n      <li parentName=\"ul\"><strong parentName=\"li\">{`Focus`}</strong>{` tells us about the tools or style a character uses to achieve their goals`}</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>{`Each player should either pick, or randomly choose, one card from each of these groups.\nNo two players should have the same card.\nIf a player doesn't have a strong idea of what they want to play, they should pick a card randomly.\nAny player can put a card back and pick another one if they're unsatisfied with the card they got.`}</p>\n    <p>{`If a player wants to play a character that doesn't conform to the available cards,\nthey can talk to the GM about writing one or more custom cards.\nCharacters should still begin with three total cards.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Once characters are created, the group can decide why they are together.\nLook at the pole stars for ideas, or come up with something else.\nFor example, if the game has a pole star like \"the old forest\",\nthe characters might have met while one went to explore it,\nanother one went to stop the first one, and a third is a guardian of the forest.`}</p>\n    <h1>{`Starting the game (\"Session 1\")`}</h1>\n    <p>{`One of the Pixar \"rules of storytelling\" is\n\"Once upon a time there was (blank). Every day, (blank).\nOne day, (blank). Because of that, (blank). Until finally, (blank).\"`}</p>\n    <p>{`Character creation answers \"once upon a time\".\nThe group's next job is to answer \"every day\" and \"one day\".\nYou can do this in two ways:`}</p>\n    <ul>\n      <li parentName=\"ul\">{`Get the players to feel comfortable inhabiting their characters`}</li>\n      <li parentName=\"ul\">{`Give the players something interesting to engage with`}</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>{`To get players to inhabit their PCs,\nstart asking questions, and follow up on the answers with driving questions.\nFor example, ask \"how does Tana spend her day on the farm?\"\nor ask \"where do Emory's duties as squire take him?\"\nFollow through with these questions until people seem satisfied.`}</p>\n    <p>{`To give characters something to engage with as a group,\ncreate an encounter. See \"scenes and encounters\" for details.`}</p>\n    <h1>{`Scenes and encounters`}</h1>\n    <p>{`A `}<strong parentName=\"p\">{`scene`}</strong>{` introduces some characters,\nsets up a source of tension for them to negotiate, and then lets them settle it.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Some scenes include an `}<strong parentName=\"p\">{`encounter`}</strong>{`, which can be a person, place,\nor thing that the PCs must engage with.\nThis can be mean combat, exploration, negotiation, or any other kind of challenge.`}</p>\n    <h2>{`Starting and ending scenes`}</h2>\n    <p>{`A scene starts when something is at stake,\nor there's a pressing question,\nand PC choices are how we resolve it.`}</p>\n    <p>{`A scene ends when the stake is settled, the question is answered,\nor the circumstances have changed, and there's something that propels the PCs toward a new scene.`}</p>\n    <p>{`The GM should make sure the group understands:`}</p>\n    <ul>\n      <li parentName=\"ul\">{`the stakes or the question facing the group`}</li>\n      <li parentName=\"ul\">{`the time and place for the scene, including details like weather`}</li>\n      <li parentName=\"ul\">{`any non-PC participants in the scene, including adversaries`}</li>\n      <li parentName=\"ul\">{`any special rules for handling the scene`}</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>{`The GM, as Facilitator, keeps the action flowing by moving the spotlight\nand asking questions.\nOnce none of the scene participants seem to have anything else to do,\nthe scene ends.`}</p>\n    <h2>{`Genre conventions and safety tools`}</h2>\n    <p>{`Sometimes, we play to find out what's going to happen next.\nBut often, we have some kind of assumption, stated or not,\nabout what can or can't happen.`}</p>\n    <p>{`For example, if a peaceful village is under threat of being razed by an army,\nor poisoned, or enslaved, a lot of gamers will feel that this threat actually\nhappening is not something they're comfortable with.\nThat's perfectly okay, and should be respected.`}</p>\n    <p>{`The way to respect it is to change the stakes or the question that drive a scene.\nFor example, we can go from \"will the village be annihilated\"\nto \"what does it cost to save the village\".\nThe challenge of trying to stop the event can be plenty exciting (and dangerous).`}</p>\n    <p>{`Similarly, if having the PCs cool their heels in a dungeon for years isn't interesting,\na question like \"do we escape the dungeon\" can be rephrased as \"how do we escape the dungeon\".\nThe PCs might encounter a prisoner who has a way out but needs their help to enact it,\nor they might trick the guards, or the cavalry might arrive,\nor the dungeon itself might even be damaged somehow (via earthquake or flooding),\nmaking the escape perhaps more dangerous than the stay.`}</p>\n    <h2>{`Building scenes from encounter cards`}</h2>\n    <p>{`It's not always clear what the PCs should have to deal with next.\nExamples of when this can happen:`}</p>\n    <ul>\n      <li parentName=\"ul\">{`When the game has just started, and nobody's sure what should happen`}</li>\n      <li parentName=\"ul\">{`When an encounter feels like it should logically happen,\nbut the players don't have a specific idea of what`}</li>\n      <li parentName=\"ul\">{`When the PCs are en route (either literally traveling or between major story goals)\nand some surprises, interruptions, or complications feel appropriate`}</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>{`In this case, you can create scenes from the encounter cards.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Draw two encounter cards at random.\nThen draw an emotion card.\nInterpret the results of the draw by thinking about what stakes or questions\narise from the combination of the PCs, the pole stars, and these cards.`}</p>\n    <p>{`The emotion card suggests the dominant mood or feeling the scene should project.\nThe encounter cards tell us more about what the character(s) or situation(s)\nin the scene can or will do.\nThe goal is to get the players thinking about specifics.\nIf any card doesn't feel right,\nit's okay to discard and draw, or just outright pick (or create) a card.`}</p>\n    <h3>{`Example stakes and questions`}</h3>\n    <ul>\n      <li parentName=\"ul\">{`We need to reach the castle to warn the king`}</li>\n      <li parentName=\"ul\">{`What's the chieftain really planning?`}</li>\n      <li
